## General guidelines and philosophy

This is a list of things we would like to have and maintain across time. Please do your best to abide by them.

- We are geared towards a mostly-Rust codebase, except on interactions with OS native modules (eg. C++ on Windows and Objective-C on macOS). We decided to stay on the native langauges on each platform, but if it's possible to make a change into Rust, submit a PR and we'll see what can we do.
- Everything should be explained on the documentation via drawings, markdown files, etc, but it is important to make it clear. There will always be some new guy or gal into the project we want to welcome ðŸ˜„.
- Use clear variable names and try to avoid confusing abbreviations. Think that your peers may not be fully fluent in English ðŸ’¬.
